1. Introduction:

The "Mass-Mail Dispatcher" is a web application designed to streamline the process of sending mass emails. It allows users to upload a 	CSV file containing numerous email addresses, validates each email, and sends the specified content only to valid email addresses. This 	project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on creating an efficient, user-friendly, and reliable mass email dispatching tool.

2. Objectives:

•	To develop a web application that can handle bulk email dispatches efficiently.
•	To implement a system that validates email addresses, ensuring that only valid emails receive the content.
•	To provide an easy-to-use interface for users to upload CSV files containing email addresses.
•	To ensure that the application is scalable and can handle large volumes of email addresses.

3. Scope:

	The Mass-Mail Dispatcher is intended for businesses, organizations, and individuals who need to send emails to large groups of 	recipients. This application is particularly useful for marketing campaigns, newsletters, and other bulk email communications.



4. Functional Requirements:

	CSV File Upload:

		The user must be able to upload a CSV file containing a list of email addresses.
		The application should parse the CSV file to extract email addresses.

	Email Validation:

The application must validate each email address using standard email validation   techniques.
		The emails should be classified as either valid or invalid.

	Email Dispatch:

		The application should only send the content to the valid email addresses.
		The content for the email should be customizable by the user.

	User Interface:

A simple and intuitive UI should be provided for users to upload CSV files, input email content, and trigger the dispatch process.
Feedback should be provided to the user, indicating the number of emails sent, as well as the number of invalid emails detected.
	



	Error Handling:

Proper error handling mechanisms should be implemented to manage issues like incorrect file formats, missing fields, or network errors during email dispatch.

5. Technical Details:

	Frontend:

HTML/CSS: Used for structuring and styling the web application. The layout is designed to be responsive, ensuring usability across different devices.

	JavaScript: 
Core logic for handling file uploads, parsing CSV files, validating email addresses, and triggering the email dispatch process.

	Email Validation:
Email validation is performed using regular expressions to check the format of the email addresses. Additional validation may include checking the domain and verifying the existence of the email address.

	Security:
The application ensures that user data is handled securely. Measures are taken to prevent potential security issues such as file injection attacks.





6. Implementation Process:

	Planning & Requirements Gathering:
Detailed requirements were gathered, focusing on the needs of users who frequently send bulk emails.

	Design:
The application design focused on simplicity, ensuring that users can easily upload files and send emails without requiring technical expertise.

	Development:
The frontend was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. CSV parsing and email validation were implemented using JavaScript.

	Testing:
Extensive testing was carried out to ensure that the application correctly validates emails, handles various edge cases, and reliably sends emails to valid addresses.	

	Deployment:
The application was deployed on a web server, making it accessible via a web browser.
